abstract="The year 1987 was the 300th anniversary of the publication of Newton's Principia, the book that laid the foundations of the whole of modern theoretical physics. Properly speaking, theoretical physics began with this book. At almost the same time mathematical analysis began. The first publication on analysis was in 1684, and it was due not to Newton, since he did not publish his discoveries in this field, but to Leibniz.",
